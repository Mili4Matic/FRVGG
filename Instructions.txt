Instructions for Setting Up the Face Recognition Program
--------------------------------------------------------

1. **Download and Install Miniconda**:
   - Go to the Miniconda download page: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
   - Download the installer for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions for Miniconda.

2. **Create a New Conda Environment**:
   - Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows).
   - Create a new environment named `face_recog` with Python 3.8.19:
     ```
     conda create -n face_recog python=3.8.19
     ```
   - Activate the new environment:
     ```
     conda activate face_recog
     ```

3. **Download the Repository from GitHub**:
   - Clone the repository containing the program and requirements:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Mili4Matic/FRVGG.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the cloned repository:
     ```
     cd FRVGG
     ```

4. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Install the required dependencies using pip:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Prepare the Known Faces Directory**:
   - Create a directory for known faces. The structure should be:
     ```
     /path/to/known/
     ├── person1/
     │   ├── image1.jpg
     │   ├── image2.jpg
     │   └── ...
     ├── person2/
     │   ├── image1.jpg
     │   ├── image2.png
     │   └── ...
     └── ...
     ```
   - Place images of known individuals in their respective directories.

6. **Run the Program**:
   - Ensure your webcam is connected.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Python script if you are not already there:
     ```
     cd FRVGG
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```
     python FRS.py
     ```
   - The program will open a window showing the webcam feed. It will attempt to recognize known faces and label them accordingly.

7. **Close the Program**:
   - To close the program, press 'q' or the 'Esc' key.

That's it! You've set up and run the face recognition program. If you encounter any issues, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the directory structure is properly organized.
